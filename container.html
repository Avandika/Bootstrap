        <h2>C Programming</h2>
    <p>C is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Dennis 
        Ritchie at Bell Labs in the 1970s. It's known for its efficiency, portability, and 
        ability to interact with hardware directly. C is often called the "mother of programming 
        languages" because many other languages, like C++, Java, and Python, have been influenced by it.C is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Dennis
